* **Dynamic UI:** Buttons automatically disable when a limit is reached.
* **Visual Feedback:** The layout changes color and displays a "Limit reached!" message at 0 and 10.
* **Modern Design:** Uses glassmorphism-inspired shadows, rounded corners, and smooth hover animations.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **CSS3:** Custom styling and Flexbox layout.
* **JavaScript:** Logic and DOM manipulation.

🧠 What I Learned

During this project, I practiced:

    Using conditional statements (if/else) to manage app state.

    Deploying a live site using GitHub Pages....
